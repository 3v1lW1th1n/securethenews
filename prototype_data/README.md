This is a single set of TLS scan data for an initial set of news site domains.
It is meant to be used for prototyping visualizations and pages for Secure The
News.

The list of domains is in `domains.csv`. This is the same list of news site
domains that was used for an [FPF survey of STARTTLS deployment by
newsrooms](https://freedom.press/blog/2015/02/why-arent-more-news-organizations-protecting-e-mail-with-starttls).

The output was generated by:

1. `git clone https://github.com/18F/domain-scan`
2. Set up Docker on your local machine
3. `docker-compose build`
4. Copy `domains.csv` to the root of the `domain-scan` repo. This directory is linked to `/home/scanner` on the scan container (see `domain-scan/docker-compose.yml`).
5. Run: `docker-compose run scan domains.csv --scan=inspect,sslyze`
6. Copy the output from `domain-scan/results` to this directory.

During the scan, a single error was reported: `Bad news reading XML, sorry!`.
From examining the source code, this appears to occur when `sslyze` fails to
return valid XML for a domain. Thus, at least one domain may be missing from
the `sslyze.csv` output (I have not verified this).
